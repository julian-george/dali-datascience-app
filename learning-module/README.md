## Objective

The objective of my machine learning module will be to predict the profit of a sale based on several pre-determined characteristics. This is a useful, real-life application, because

## Acknowledgements

My linear regression implementation borrows heavily from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression)

## Usage

Feel free to set this up in a virtual environment - I didn't use one in development. To set it up, I do the following:

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python3 classification-learning.py` to run the classification model or `python3 regression-learning.py` to run the regression model
